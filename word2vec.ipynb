      "Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: It's nice.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on \"waiting too long\", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, \"up close\"?\n",
      "Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!\n",
      "Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Uh, \"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!\" Whatever man! It's a trick.\n",
      "Thor: Well please, be my guest.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Come on.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Really?\n",
      "Thor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]\n",
      "James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]\n",
      "Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?\n",
      "Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Okay.\n",
      "James Rhodes: Uh-oh.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Um-hmm.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Get after it.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.\n",
      "Tony Stark: It's physics.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?\n",
      "Thor: Yes, of course.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]\n",
      "James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?\n",
      "Tony Stark: Are you on my team?\n",
      "James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!\n",
      "Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.\n",
      "James Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]\n",
      "Thor: Nothing.\n",
      "Tony Stark: And?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Widow?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.\n",
      "Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.\n",
      "Clint Barton: You bet your ass.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?\n",
      "Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. \"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints\" is, I think, the literal translation?\n",
      "Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]\n",
      "Ultron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Stark.\n",
      "Tony Stark: JARVIS.\n",
      "Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?\n",
      "Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.\n",
      "Ultron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You killed someone?\n",
      "Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.\n",
      "Thor: Who sent you?\n",
      "Ultron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] \"I see a suit of armor around the world\".\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Ultron!\n",
      "Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: What mission?\n",
      "Ultron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Sorry!\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Come!\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]\n",
      "Iron Legion: We are here to help.\n",
      "Tony Stark: One sec, one sec!\n",
      "Iron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.\n",
      "Tony Stark: No more. That's the one.\n",
      "Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]\n",
      "Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Ultron.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.\n",
      "James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.\n",
      "James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.\n",
      "Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.\n",
      "Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: This is insane.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.\n",
      "Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.\n",
      "Thor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]\n",
      "Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.\n",
      "Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]\n",
      "Thor: You think this is funny?\n",
      "Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.\n",
      "Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.\n",
      "Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...\n",
      "Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.\n",
      "Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?\n",
      "James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Saved New York?\n",
      "James Rhodes: Never heard that.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Together.\n",
      "Tony Stark: We'll lose.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...\n",
      "Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]\n",
      "Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.\n",
      "Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?\n",
      "Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...\n",
      "Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.\n",
      "Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.\n",
      "Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.\n",
      "Ultron: No, please.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Stark.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, \"This will set it off.\" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.\n",
      "Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]\n",
      "Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Fatalities?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]\n",
      "Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Gotta go.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Who was that?\n",
      "Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]\n",
      "Tony Stark: What's this?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.\n",
      "Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very \"Ahab.\"\n",
      "Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...\n",
      "Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What dialect?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.\n",
      "Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]\n",
      "Tony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]\n",
      "Ultron: There is no \"man\" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]\n",
      "Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, \"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.\"\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: Stark.\n",
      "Ultron: What?\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.\n",
      "Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.\n",
      "Ultron: If I have to.\n",
      "Thor: We don't have to break anything.\n",
      "Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.\n",
      "Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?\n",
      "Tony Stark: This was never my life.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.\n",
      "Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...\n",
      "Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.\n",
      "Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?\n",
      "Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: Shoot them!\n",
      "Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?\n",
      "Ulysses Klaue: All of them!\n",
      "Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!\n",
      "Ultron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?\n",
      "Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]\n",
      "Ultron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]\n",
      "Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]\n",
      "Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.\n",
      "Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]\n",
      "Madame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]\n",
      "Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]\n",
      "Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?\n",
      "Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!\n",
      "Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]\n",
      "Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]\n",
      "Thor: I can still save you.\n",
      "Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]\n",
      "Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.\n",
      "Madame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]\n",
      "Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.\n",
      "Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.\n",
      "Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]\n",
      "Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]\n",
      "Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?\n",
      "Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.\n",
      "Tony Stark: So, run and hide?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?\n",
      "Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.\n",
      "Tony Stark: A few hours from where?\n",
      "Clint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]\n",
      "Thor: What is this place?\n",
      "Tony Stark: A safe house?\n",
      "Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.\n",
      "Laura Barton: Hey.\n",
      "Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.\n",
      "Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.\n",
      "Laura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]\n",
      "Barton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]\n",
      "Clint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...\n",
      "Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!\n",
      "Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.\n",
      "Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?\n",
      "Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thor.\n",
      "Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]\n",
      "Peggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]\n",
      "Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?\n",
      "Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.\n",
      "Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?\n",
      "Clint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]\n",
      "Laura Barton: You are so cute.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?\n",
      "Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.\n",
      "Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.\n",
      "Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those \"Gods\"...\n",
      "Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.\n",
      "Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.\n",
      "Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]\n",
      "Laura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]\n",
      "Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.\n",
      "Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?\n",
      "Ultron: I expect you to know why.\n",
      "Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] \"This is the next thing, Tony.\"\n",
      "Ultron: This...is the next me.\n",
      "Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.\n",
      "Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Missed our window.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Did we?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...\n",
      "Bruce Banner: What did you dream?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: What are you doing?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?\n",
      "Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.\n",
      "Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.\n",
      "Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the \"why\" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]\n",
      "Laura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]\n",
      "Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.\n",
      "Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.\n",
      "Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.\n",
      "Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.\n",
      "Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.\n",
      "Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.\n",
      "Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.\n",
      "Thor: I need your help.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.\n",
      "Thor: It's dangerous.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]\n",
      "Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.\n",
      "Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.\n",
      "Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: NEXUS?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.\n",
      "Clint Barton: So what'd they say?\n",
      "Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.\n",
      "Tony Stark: By whom?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Parties unknown.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?\n",
      "Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our \"unknown.\"\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.\n",
      "Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]\n",
      "Nick Fury: So what does he want?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.\n",
      "Nick Fury: How?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]\n",
      "Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...\n",
      "Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...\n",
      "Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.\n",
      "Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?\n",
      "Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?\n",
      "Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.\n",
      "Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.\n",
      "Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.\n",
      "Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.\n",
      "Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]\n",
      "Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.\n",
      "World Hub Tech: How do you find it?\n",
      "Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]\n",
      "Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Thor!\n",

      "Ultron: How could I what?\n",

      "Ultron: Ask Noah.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.\n",
      "Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]\n",

      "Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?\n",
      "Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: No.\n",
      "Tony Stark: You have to trust me.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]\n",
      "JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?\n",
      "Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?\n",
      "Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.\n",
      "JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.\n",
      "Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, \"What doesn't kill me…[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] \"…just makes me stronger.\" [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]\n",
      "Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.\n",
      "Tony Stark: How about \"nonce\"?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Shut it down!\n",
      "Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...\n",
      "Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!\n",
      "Steve Rogers: This isn't a game...\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!\n",
      "Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]\n",
      "Vision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?\n",
      "Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: What, the gem?\n",
      "Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...\n",
      "Thor: Because Stark is right.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.\n",
      "Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.\n",
      "Vision: Not alone.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Why does your \"vision\" sound like JARVIS?\n",
      "Tony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.\n",
      "Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You're not?\n",
      "Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.\n",
      "Vision: Look again.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.\n",
      "Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?\n",
      "Vision: I don't think it's that simple.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.\n",
      "Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.\n",
      "Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?\n",
      "Vision: You.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Where?\n",
      "Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...\n",
      "Vision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]\n",
      "Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]\n",
      "FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.\n",
      "Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.\n",
      "Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.\n",
      "Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]\n",
      "FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]\n",
      "Ultron: Come to confess your sins?\n",
      "Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?\n",
      "Ultron: More than you.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...\n",
      "Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?\n",
      "Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?\n",
      "FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.\n",
      "Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Go!\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]\n",
      "Vision: Ultron.\n",
      "Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.\n",
      "Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.\n",
      "Ultron: Alright. [they start battling it out]\n",
      "Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?\n",
      "FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.\n",
      "Ultron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]\n",
      "Tony Stark: FRIDAY?\n",
      "FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]\n",
      "Ultron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]\n",
      "Bruce Banner: We gotta move.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?\n",
      "Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]\n",
      "FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.\n",
      "Tony Stark: If it drops?\n",
      "FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]\n",
      "FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Go, go, move!\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.\n",
      "Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]\n",
      "Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?\n",
      "Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!\n",
      "Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]\n",
      "Clint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. \"The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.\"\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]\n",
      "FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.\n",
      "Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...\n",
      "FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.\n",
      "FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?\n",
      "Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?\n",
      "Nick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.\n",
      "Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.\n",
      "Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.\n",
      "Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.\n",
      "Maria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]\n",
      "James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.\n",
      "James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?\n",
      "Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.\n",
      "James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.\n",
      "Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!\n",
      "Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]\n",
      "Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]\n",
      "Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.\n",
      "Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]\n",
      "Vision: It's terribly well balanced.\n",
      "Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.\n",
      "Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.\n",
      "FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!\n",
      "Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.\n",
      "James Rhodes: On it.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.\n",
      "Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing \"hide the zucchini.\"\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?\n",
      "Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]\n",
      "Thor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You had to ask.\n",
      "Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?\n",
      "Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]\n",
      "Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]\n",
      "Thor: They'll try to leave the city.\n",
      "Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!\n",
      "James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.\n",
      "Clint Barton: What about the core?\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: You understand?\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: Go.\n",
      "FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...\n",
      "Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]\n",
      "Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.\n",
      "Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]\n",
      "Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.\n",
      "Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.\n",
      "Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.\n",
      "Thor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]\n",
      "Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]\n",
      "Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]\n",
      "Ultron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]\n",
      "Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]\n",
      "Ultron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.\n",
      "Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]\n",
      "Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]\n",
      "Vision: You're afraid.\n",

      "Steve Rogers: Why me?\n",
      "Dr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the… [he waves his hand] And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, \"You.\" He says, \"You will make us strong.\" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.\n",
      "[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine’s formula and injects himself with it]\n",
      "Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?\n",
      "Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.\n",
      "Dr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.\n",

The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side.

In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada.

      "Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. [Thor places his hand Jane's face] I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.\n",
      "Jane Foster: What?\n",
      "Thor: I know...\n",
      "Jane Foster: You do?\n",
      "Thor: Do what? [they lean in close and just as they are about to kiss Darcy interrupts them; referring to the rain]\n",

      "Jane Foster: Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.\n",
      "Jane Foster: [to Thor] Hold that thought. [she turns and runs towards the police]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?\n",
      "Thor: Space is fine. [Jane walks over to the police]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Excuse me?\n",
      "Police Officer #1: Are you Jane Foster?\n",
      "Jane Foster: Yes.\n",
      "Police Officer #1: [referring to Ian] Do you know this man?\n",
      "Jane Foster: He's my intern. My intern's intern.\n",
      "Police Officer #1: This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me. [the police officer goes t grab Jane's arm but suddenly the force from the Aether creates a powerful force which pushes the officer and everything else away, Thor runs towards Jane who's lying on the ground]\n",
      "Thor: Jane! Jane? [he helps her stand] You alright?\n",
      "Jane Foster: What just happened? [the other police officer approaches Jane apprehensively]\n",

      "Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [Thor and Jane travel through the Bifrost and enter Asgard where Heimdall is guarding as always, Jane looks around her in amazement]\n",
      "Jane Foster: We have to do that again. [she notices Heimdall for the first time] Hi.\n",
      "Heimdall: Welcome to Asgard. [returning to their homeland, Svartalfheim, Malekith kneels and grabs a handful of dust from the ground]\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light. [Algrim places his hand on Malekith's shoulder]\n",
      "Algrim: [subtitled] Our survival will be your legacy.\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world. [as the Asgardian physicians study Jane and the force within her]\n",
      "Jane Foster: What's that?\n",
      "Eir: Be still. [Thor watches with one of the nurses as they examine Jane]\n",
      "Thor: This is not of Earth, what is it?\n",
      "Asgardian Nurse: We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her. [the nurse turns and walks away as Thor looks at Jane with worry]\n",
      "Jane Foster: That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?\n",
      "Eir: It's a Soul Forge.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another? [Eir looks impressed]\n",

      "Odin: I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oh. Well, I'm...\n",
      "Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster. [Jane turns to look at Thor]\n",
      "Jane Foster: You told your Dad about me?\n",
      "Thor: Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.\n",
      "Odin: Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard. [as two guards approach Jane and go to grab her, suddenly the energy force within her sets off again throwing the two guards aside]\n",
      "Thor: Don't touch her. [he leans down and tenderly touches Jane] Jane, are you alright? [Jane nods her head, Odin inspects the energy force running through Jane's body and realizes it's the Aether]\n",
      "Odin: That's impossible.\n",
      "Eir: The infection, it's defending her.\n",
      "Thor: No, it's defending itself.\n",
      "Odin: Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.\n",
      "Thor: [reading from the book] \"Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light.\" They were these stories mother told us as children.\n",
      "Odin: Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.\n",
      "Jane Foster: What happened?\n",
      "Odin: He killed them all.\n",
      "Thor: Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.\n",
      "Odin: The Dark Elves are dead.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?\n",
      "Odin: No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim]\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife]\n",
      "Algrim: [subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.\n",
      "Algrim: [subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]\n",

      "Frigga: I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.\n",
      "Loki: Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.\n",
      "Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\n",
      "Loki: My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.\n",
      "Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\n",
      "Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.\n",
      "Frigga: Your father...\n",
      "Loki: [shouts] He's not my father!\n",
      "Frigga: Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment]\n",
      "Loki: You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes]\n",
      "Frigga: Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

      "Jane Foster: When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.\n",
      "Thor: Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Well, how's that possible?\n",
      "Thor: I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]\n",
      "Jane Foster: I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?\n",
      "Thor: I'll find a way to save you, Jane.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Your father said there was...\n",
      "Thor: My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga]\n",
      "Frigga: Don't let him hear you say that.\n",
      "Thor: Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]\n",
      "Loki: You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off]\n",
      "Frigga: The prisons.\n",
      "Thor: Loki.\n",
      "Frigga: [referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]\n",
      "Fandral: It's as if they resent being imprisoned.\n",
      "Volstagg: There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]\n",
      "Thor: Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]\n",
      "Odin: [to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.\n",
      "Frigga: Odin.\n",
      "Odin: Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.\n",
      "Frigga: You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them]\n",
      "Odin: Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.\n",
      "Frigga: You take care.\n",
      "Odin: Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.\n",
      "Frigga: It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]\n",
      "Odin: Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room]\n",
      "Frigga: Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.\n",
      "Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.\n",
      "Frigga: Who are you?\n",
      "Malekith: I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?\n",
      "Frigga: I'll never tell.\n",
      "Malekith: I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]\n",
      "Patient: Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith]\n",
      "Algrim: [subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]\n",
      "Einherjar Lieutenant: Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship]\n",
      "Fandral: We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]\n",
      "Thor: She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]\n",
      "Odin: I do not wish to fight with you.\n",
      "Thor: Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.\n",
      "Odin: We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.\n",
      "Thor: Yes, and you will destroy us.\n",
      "Odin: You overestimate the power of these creatures.\n",
      "Thor: No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.\n",
      "Odin: If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.\n",
      "Thor: The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.\n",
      "Odin: If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.\n",
      "Thor: And how of our men shall fall on theirs?\n",
      "Odin: As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.\n",
      "Thor: And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles]\n",
      "Odin: The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!\n",
      "Ian Boothby: What's SHIELD?\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. [as Ian is watching the news they start reporting about Erik being arrested at Stonehenge]\n",
      "News Reporter: Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]\n",
      "News Reporter: ...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm...

      "Thor: You're not in Odin's war council?\n",
      "Heimdall: The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated]\n",
      "Thor: Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.\n",
      "Heimdall: I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thor: I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.\n",
      "Heimdall: As are we all.\n",
      "Thor: Well I see clearly enough.\n",
      "Heimdall: The risks are too great.\n",
      "Thor: Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]\n",
      "Heimdall: What do you require of me?\n",
      "Thor: What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.\n",
      "Sif: The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.\n",

      "Loki: Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\n",
      "Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]\n",
      "Loki: Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?\n",
      "Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\n",
      "Loki: Go on.\n",
      "Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]\n",
      "Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\n",
      "Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]\n",
      "Loki: Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades]\n",
      "Fandral: He will betray you.\n",
      "Thor: He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison]\n",
      "Loki: This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?\n",
      "Thor: If you keep speaking I just might.\n",
      "Loki: Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?\n",
      "Thor It's better company at least.\n",
      "Loki: Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]\n",
      "Thor: It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.\n",
      "Loki: Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer– [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]\n",
      "Thor: And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades]\n",
      "Fandral: Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.\n",
      "Thor: I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters]\n",
      "Jane Foster: I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]\n",
      "Sif: Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]\n",
      "Jane Foster: You're...\n",
      "Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face]\n",
      "Jane Foster: That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor]\n",
      "Loki: I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades]\n",
      "Sif: And what of the All-Father?\n",
      "Heimdall: It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards]\n",
      "Odin: You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?\n",
      "Heimdall: Treason, my lord.\n",
      "Odin: Whose?\n",

      "Volstagg: Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.\n",
      "Thor: That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]\n",

      "Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\n",
      "Thor: I said, \"how hard could it be?\" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]\n",
      "Guard: They're on the ship!\n",
      "Loki: They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.\n",
      "Thor: Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]\n",
      "Loki: You must have missed something.\n",
      "Thor: No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.\n",
      "Loki: No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]\n",
      "Thor: I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]\n",
      "Guards: Get him! Get him!\n",
      "[Volstagg starts laughing as they watch the ship start to rise, hitting the columns of the palace]\n",
      "Loki: I think you missed a column.\n",
      "Thor: Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard]\n",
      "Loki: Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.\n",
      "Thor: Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]\n",
      "Loki: Oh, dear. Is she dead?\n",
      "Thor: Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]\n",
      "Jane Foster: I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]\n",
      "Thor: Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them]\n",
      "Loki: Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!\n",
      "Thor: Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]\n",
      "Loki: Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]\n",
      "Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]\n",
      "Loki: You lied to me. I'm impressed.\n",
      "Thor: I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.\n",
      "Fandral: Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]\n",
      "Thor: Loki!\n",
      "Loki: If it were easy everyone would do it.\n",
      "Thor: Are you mad?\n",
      "Loki: Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]\n",
      "Algrim: [subtitled] We must attack now.\n",
      "Malekith: [subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]\n",
      "Loki: [sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.\n",
      "Thor: It would consume you.\n",
      "Loki: She's holding up alright, for now.\n",
      "Thor: She's strong in ways you'd never even know.\n",
      "Loki: Say goodbye.\n",
      "Thor: Not this day.\n",
      "Loki: This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.\n",
      "Thor: And will that satisfy you?\n",
      "Loki: Satisfaction is not in my nature.\n",
      "Thor: Surrender not in mine.\n",
      "Loki: The son of Odin.\n",
      "Thor: No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\n",
      "Loki: Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!\n",
      "Thor: What help were you in your cell?\n",
      "Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki]\n",
      "Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.\n",
      "Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]\n",
      "Thor: I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki]\n",
      "Loki: Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]\n",
      "Desk Officer: You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]\n",
      "Desk Officer: One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Erik.\n",
      "Desk Officer: And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Erik.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Yes?\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: It's uh...Darcy.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: How did you find me?\n",
      "Ian Boothby: You were naked on TV.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?\n",
      "Erik Selvig: I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: It's happening, sooner than I calculated.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?\n",
      "Ian Boothby: They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Erik?\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?\n",
      "Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]\n",
      "Thor: Jane.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]\n",
      "Thor: Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]\n",
      "Loki: I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.\n",
      "Thor: Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]\n",
      "Loki: You still don't trust me, brother?\n",
      "Thor: Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs]\n",
      "Loki: No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]\n",
      "Loki: You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.\n",
      "Algrim: [to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]\n",
      "Malekith: Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]\n",
      "Thor: Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]\n",
      "Loki: See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]\n",
      "Thor: No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!\n",
      "Loki: I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain]\n",
      "Thor: Stay with me, okay?\n",
      "Loki: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n",
      "Thor: Shh.\n",
      "Loki: I'm sorry.\n",
      "Thor: It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.\n",
      "Loki: I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]\n",
      "Thor: No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]\n",
      "Jane Foster: He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.\n",
      "Thor: How? Jane, how?\n",
      "Jane Foster: I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?\n",
      "Thor: The Convergence.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.\n",
      "Thor: Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.\n",
      "Jane Foster: I only found it because I was looking for you.\n",
      "Thor: Jane. [he places his hand on her face]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]\n",
      "Thor: It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Hello?\n",
      "Richard: Hi, Jane, it's Richard.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Richard?! Where are you?\n",
      "Richard: I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oh, my God! This is amazing.\n",
      "Richard: Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.\n",
      "Jane Foster: How am I getting service here?\n",
      "Richard: Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?\n",
      "Jane Foster: No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.\n",
      "Richard: Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?\n",
      "Richard: Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]\n",
      "Richard: Am I interrupting something.\n",
      "Jane Foster: No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.\n",
      "Richard: I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]\n",
      "Thor: Where are we going?\n",
      "Richard: [to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\n",
      "Thor: Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone]\n",
      "Richard: I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Jane!\n",
      "Jane Foster: Hey.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Erik?!\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Where are your pants?\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Okay.\n",
      "Thor: Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Your brother is not coming, is he?\n",
      "Thor: Loki is dead.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.\n",
      "Thor: Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]\n",
      "Einherjar Guard: Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.\n",
      "Odin: Thor?\n",
      "Einherjar Guard: There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]\n",
      "Odin: What?\n",
      "Einherjar Guard: We found a body. [there's a moment's pause]\n",
      "Odin: Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.\n",
      "Thor: Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Well, how do we know where that is?\n",
      "Erik Selvig: We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it. [Erik places a map of the British Isles on the coffee table] All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map. [he starts drawing on the map] Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here. [he points to Greenwich on the map]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Greenwich?\n",
      "Jane Foster: The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.\n",
      "Ian Boothby: They're taped together!\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Do you even know what these things do?\n",
      "Ian Boothby: No.\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]\n",
      "Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.\n",
      "Thor: Not by your hand!\n",
      "Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: We're running out of time.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Almost there.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]\n",
      "Thor: You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.\n",
      "Jane Foster: That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: That is awesome! How did you do that?\n",
      "Jane Foster: Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Oops.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch]\n",
      "Jane Foster: What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!\n",
      "Student: You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]\n",
      "Control: Confirming ship is hostile.\n",
      "Pilot: Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.\n",
      "Control: Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...\n",
      "Pilot: Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: What are you doing?\n",
      "Jane Foster: My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Are you alright?\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: You saved my life.\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Darcy?\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Ian?\n",
      "Ian Boothby: Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them]\n",
      "Darcy Lewis: Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station]\n",
      "Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\n",
      "[Thor turns to one of the passengers on the underground train that's just arrived]\n",
      "Thor: How do I get to Greenwich?\n",
      "Woman on Train: Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]\n",
      "Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\n",
      "[as the train starts to move, the movement causes the woman to fall against Thor and she stops herself by placing her hand on his chest]\n",
      "Woman on Train: Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her]\n",
      "[in Greenwich the realms come closer to converging, Malekith readies the Aether within him to bring forth the darkness]\n",
      "Jane Foster: We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead]\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over]\n",
      "Jane Foster: Thor! We're too late.\n",
      "Erik Selvig: The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand]\n",
      "Thor: Can those things stop him?\n",
      "Erik Selvig: Not from here.\n",
      "Jane Foster: We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane]\n",
      "Thor: I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor]\n",
      "Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?\n",
      "Thor: I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]\n",
      "Malekith: You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.\n",
      "Thor: But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]\n",

      "[Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his apartment though the window, he grabs his shield for protection and finds Fury sitting on his couch in the dark]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I don't remember giving you a key.\n",
      "Nick Fury: You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Didn't know you were married.\n",
      "Nick Fury: A lot of things you don't about me.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I know, Nick. That's the problem. [as Steve turns on the light he notices Fury's injuries for the first time, but Fury indicates for him to be silent, he turns off the light and writes something on his phone and shows it to Steve; \"ears everywhere\"]\n",
      "Nick Fury: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. [he writes another text and shows it to Steve; \"SHIELD compromised\"]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Who else knows about your wife? [Fury shows him another text; \"You and me\"]\n",
      "Nick Fury: Just...my friends.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Is that what we are?\n",
      "Nick Fury: That's up to you. [suddenly Fury is shot three times from through the wall and collapses, Steve looks out the window for the shooter then he quickly drags Fury to the next room, before he leaves Fury hands him the flash drive] Don't...trust anyone. [Fury passes out] [Steve hears someone breaking into his apartment and hears his neighbor calling out to him]\n",
      "Sharon Carter: Captain Rogers? [Steve sees her walking in with her gun pointed] Captain, I'm Agent 13 of SHIELD Special Service.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Kate?\n",
      "Sharon Carter: I'm assigned to protect you.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: On whose order? [She notices Fury lying injured on the ground]\n",
      "Sharon Carter: His. [she goes to Fury then contacts SHIELD through her radio] Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.\n",
      "SHIELD Agent: Do you have a twenty on the shooter? [Steve notices the shooter though the window]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Tell him I'm in pursuit. [Steve smashes through his window and runs after the assassin, who is the same mysterious man that had exploded Fury's car, Steve chases him through an office building smashing through the walls, when he finally catches up with him on the roof he throws his shield at the assassin, but he catches it with one swift move, then throws it back to Steve and then jumps down the building and disappears.]\n",
      "[Natasha goes to the hospital and meets up with Steve, they watch doctors operating on Fury]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Is he gonna make it?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I don't know.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Tell me about the shooter.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: He's fast and strong. Had a metal arm. [just then Agent Maria Hill also joins them]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Ballistics?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Soviet-made.\n",
      "Maria Hill: Yeah. [suddenly they watch in shock as Fury's state deteriorates]\n",
      "Male Nurse: He's in V-tach.\n",
      "Female Nurse: Crash cart coming in.\n",
      "Doctor: Nurse, help me with the drape.\n",
      "Male Nurse: BP is dropping.\n",
      "Doctor: Defibrillator! [Steve, Natasha and Hill watch in shock as Fury is flatlining] I want you to charge him at one hundred.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick.\n",
      "Doctor: Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given a shock with the defibrillator] Pulse?\n",
      "Male Nurse: No pulse.\n",
      "Doctor #1: No pulse.\n",
      "Doctor: Okay. 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given another shock] Give me epinephrine! Pulse?\n",
      "Male Nurse: Negative.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me. [the three watch the doctors as they continue to revive Fury but Fury is still showing as flatlining, Steve turns away as they finally call his time of death]\n",
      "Doctor: What's the time?\n",
      "Female Nurse: 1:03, Doctor.\n",
      "Doctor: Time of death, 1:03 a.m. [Steve looks down at the flash drive Fury had given him]\n",
      "[Natasha and Steve are in a room where Fury's dead body has been laid out, Natasha is looking at Fury's body with tears running down her face, Hill joins them]\n",
      "Maria Hill: I need to take him. [Steve goes over to Natasha]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Natasha. [she doesn't respond, instead she tenderly touches Fury's head then turns and walks out, Steve follows her] Natasha!\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Why was Fury in your apartment?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I don't know. [they are interrupted by Rumlow]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Cap, they want you back at SHIELD.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yeah, give me a second.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: They want you now.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Okay. [Steven turns to Natasha]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: You're a terrible liar. [she turns and walks off]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: [on earpiece] STRIKE team, escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: I told him. [Steve notices the vending machine next to him, we then see Steve walking towards Rumlow]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Let's go.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Yeah. [to the agents] STRIKE, move it out. [as they leave we see that Steve has hid the flash drive behind a pack of gums in the vending machine]\n",
      "[back at SHIELD, Steve is brought to Pierce who is talking to Agent 13]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: For whatever it's worth, you did your best.\n",
      "Sharon Carter: Thank you, sir. [as she turns to leave she sees Steve] Captain Rogers. [Steve replies coldly as he walks towards Pierce]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Neighbor.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, \"No, we'll negotiate.\" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: So you gave him a promotion.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I don't know.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: You know it was bugged?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I did, because Nick told me.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated]\n",
      "SHIELD Agent: Who hired you, Batroc?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Is that live?\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: He told me not to trust anyone.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Understood. [Steve turns and leaves]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: [after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.\n",
      "SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.\n",
      "STRIKE Agent #1: Understood.\n",
      "STRIKE Agent #2: Yes, sir.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Forensics.\n",
      "SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Cap.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: No, lets wait and see what it is first.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter]\n",
      "SHIELD Agent #1: What's the status so far?\n",
      "SHIELD Agent #2: Administrations level.\n",
      "SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\n",
      "SHIELD Agent #2: [to Steve] Excuse me.\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: [to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]\n",
      "STRIKE Agent #3: Records.\n",
      "SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]\n",
      "25th Floor STRIKE Agent: Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]\n",
      "STRIKE Agent: Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]\n",
      "Quinjet Pilot: Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: [to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.\n",
      "Sharon Carter: With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.\n",
      "[disguised as a civilian dressed in a hoody, Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine but sees it's gone, then Natasha appears behind him chewing some gum, in anger Steve pushes her into a room]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Where is it?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Safe.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Do better!\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Where did you get it?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Why would I tell you?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Fury gave it to you. Why?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What's on it?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I don't know.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Stop lying!\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I only act like I know everything, Rogers.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna ask you again.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: So he's a ghost story.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.\n",
      "[Pierce is holding another virtual meeting with the World Security Council]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.\n",
      "Councilman Rockwell: You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.\n",
      "Councilman Singh: Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.\n",
      "Councilwoman Hawley: That discussion can be tabled for a later time.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: But you do want to have a discussion.\n",
      "Councilman Rockwell: We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.\n",
      "[Steve and Natasha go to the mall disguised as a civilian couple]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: How much time do we have?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Can you override it?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.\n",
      "Apple Employee: Can I help you guys with anything?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Right! We're getting married.\n",
      "Apple Employee: Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: New Jersey.\n",
      "Apple Employee: Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Wow, you two are practically twins.\n",
      "Apple Employee: Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around]\n",

      "Steve Rogers: What?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]\n",

      "Natasha Romanoff: Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Was that your first kiss since 1945?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: That bad, huh?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say that.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You don't need practice.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Everybody needs practice.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Well, that's alright, you just make something up.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What, like you?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: That's a tough way to live.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: It's a good way not to die, though.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Yeah. Who do you want me to be?\n",

      "Natasha Romanoff: Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.\n",
      "[the two pull up to outside an abandoned military base where the signal led them to]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: This is it.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: The file came from these coordinates.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Changed much?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]\n",
      "Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]\n",

      "Natasha Romanoff: Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] \"Shall we play a game?\" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: It's some kind of a recording.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Do you know this thing?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: How did you get here?\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Invited.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: HYDRA died with the Red Skull.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Prove it.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What's on this drive?\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: What kind of algorithm? What does it do?\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Who fired it?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: S.H.I.E.L.D.\n",
      "Dr. Arnim Zola: I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: [As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.\n",
      "[at his home, Pierce goes to his kitchen to get a drink when he sees the Winter Soldier sat behind behind him with his gun on the table when his housekeeper calls out]\n",
      "Renata: I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.\n",
      "Renata: Okay, night-night.\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]\n",
      "Renata: Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]\n",
      "Alexander Pierce: Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]\n",
      "[returning home from his morning run Sam hears a knock at his door, he opens the door to see Steve and Natasha]\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Hey, man.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying]\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You okay?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What's going on?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I owe you.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: It's okay.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I would now. And I'm always honest.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.\n",
      "Sam Wilson: [to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Pierce.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: So was Jasper Sitwell.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: The answer is: you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What's this?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Is this Riley?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Yeah.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I thought you said you were a pilot.\n",
      "Sam Wilson: I never said pilot.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Where can we get our hands on one of these things?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon]\n",
      "[after their meeting is over Sitwell walks out of the building with Senator Stern]\n",
      "Senator Stern: Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?\n",
      "Senator Stern: Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.\n",
      "Senator Stern: Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Thank you.\n",
      "Senator Stern: Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: I just saw that, yeah.\n",
      "Senator Stern: Should I get it checked?\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Who is this?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: What do you want?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: And why would I do that?\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Tell me about Zola's algorithm.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Never heard of it.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Lillian. Lip piercing, right?\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, she's cute.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [suddenly, Sam, in his Falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up holding Sitwell and throws him down on the roof] [Steve and Natasha walk towards Sitwell, he holds his hand up in fear]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What targets?\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs]\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. [Steve and Natasha look at him in confusion] Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: And what then?\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: What then?!\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: [as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.\n",
      "Sam Wilson: So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.\n",
      "Jasper Sitwell: What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. [suddenly the Winter Soldier lands on the car roof, pulls Sitwell out through the window and throws him into the oncoming traffic, killing him, he then starts shooting at them until Steve pulls the break handle making the Winter Soldier drop down onto the street, as another car smashes into the trio's car and pushes them along, the Winter Soldier jumps back onto their car, smashes through the windscreen and pulls out the steering wheel]\n",
      "Sam Wilson: Shit! [Natasha starts shooting at him but the Winter Soldier jumps onto the vehicle behind them, as the trio's car is being pulled off the road Steve holds on to the car door]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Hang on! [he breaks open the door, holding onto Natasha and Sam, they slide on the car door through the streets] [the Winter Soldier is joined by HYDRA agents and they start shooting at them, the trio scatter and run off in different directions with the Winter Soldier shooting at Natasha but she manages to shoot him in his eye goggle mask and run off]\n",

      "Sam Wilson: Go, I got this! [the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car as he can hear her voice]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. [he rolls a bomb towards where he thinks she's hiding. As the bomb rolls behind the car we see that Natasha isn't actually there but a recording over her voice is being played back on a phone] I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. [as the bomb explodes Natasha jumps onto the Winter Soldiers back and tries to kill him but he throws her off, she starts running off as he goes after her]\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: [to the civilians as she tries to get away from the Winter Soldier] Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! [suddenly she gets shot in the shoulder, she falls and looks around her, as the Winter Soldier comes up from behind to shoot her Steve jumps in and attacks him, they fight and in the process the Winter Soldier takes Steve's shield and throws it at him but Steve manages to avoid being hit, after battling it out more the Winter Soldier's mask comes off, as he looks around at Steve we learn the true identity of the Winter Soldier; Bucky Barnes]\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Bucky?\n",
      "Bucky Barnes: Who the hell is Bucky? [as Bucky goes to shoot at Steve Sam flies in and kicks Bucky aside, Bucky takes aim again but before he can shoot Natasha uses the grenade launcher Bucky dropped earlier to shoot at Bucky who vanishes in the smoke of the explosion, then the trio hear sirens after which they are surrounded by HYDRA agents being led by Rumlow]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down! [Steve holds his hands up] Get on your knees! Down!

[Rollins lowers his gun, the HYDRA agents then take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody]\n",
      "[as the trio is being escorted in a van]\n",

      "Sam Wilson: How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: None of that's your fault, Steve.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. [Sam notices Natasha is bleeding from her shoulder and looks at the guards]\n",
      "Sam Wilson: We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck. [suddenly one of the guards pulls out an electric rod and neutralizes the other guard and knocks him out, the guard is revealed to be Hill as she takes off her helmet]\n",
      "Maria Hill: Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain. [Sam looks at her in confusion; to Steve] Who's this guy? [Rumlow's crew stop their vehicles and get out]\n",
      "Brock Rumlow: Three holes. Start digging. [they go over to the van holding Steve, Sam and Natasha and as they open the door they find it empty with one of the guards left unconscious and massive burnt whole on the car floor]\n",
      "[Hill has taken the trio to a secret facility, a man runs towards them; referring to Natasha's wound]\n",

      "Sam Wilson: Maybe two.\n",
      "Doctor: Let me take her.\n",
      "Maria Hill: She'll want to see him first. [Hill takes them to Fury who's alive and lying in bed, the trio look at him in shock]\n",
      "Nick Fury: About damn time. [later as Natasha's wound is being treated] Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.\n",
      "Doctor: Don't forget your collapsed lung.\n",
      "Nick Fury: Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.\n",
      "Natasha Romanoff: They cut you open, your heart stopped.\n",
      "Nick Fury: Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.\n",
      "Steve Rogers: Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?\n",
      "Maria Hill: Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.\n",

      "Steve Rogers: Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not.
